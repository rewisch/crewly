# About Crewly

Crewly is a learning-based project developed alongside a course from https://lowlevel.academy.  
The main goal is to understand the concepts being taught, while also exploring my own approaches to structure, design, and implementation.  
Although it shares core functionality with the course project, some of the implementation reflects my personal decisions and experimentation.
